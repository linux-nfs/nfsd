====================================
The per-namespace NFS client keyring
====================================

The NFS client holds one keyring, named ".nfs", per network
namespace. An xprtsec=mtls mount presents the client certificate and
private key named by its cert_serial= and privkey_serial= mount
options, and the handshake links the mount's namespace .nfs keyring
into tlshd before tlshd reads those keys. Keys placed on the .nfs
keyring therefore need not grant user read permission: tlshd reaches
them as a possessor, and a tlshd in another network namespace never
possesses them.

The keyring is owned by global root, with KEY_POS_ALL and KEY_USR_ALL
less SETATTR. It is not charged to any quota. Keys added to it by
userspace are charged to the user that adds them.

Finding the keyring serial
==========================

The .nfs keyring is not linked into any keyring that userspace
possesses, so a serial is the only way to name it. The NFS client
registers a key type, "nfs_keyring", whose sole purpose is to hand
that serial out. Its request_key handler runs in the caller's context
and does not upcall to /sbin/request-key.

To obtain the serial, request a key of type "nfs_keyring" with the
description ".nfs" and read its payload::

	id=$(keyctl request2 nfs_keyring .nfs "" @s)
	serial=$(keyctl print $id)

The contract of the key type is:

 * The description is the string ".nfs". Any other description is
   rejected with EINVAL before a key is allocated.

 * The callout info must be present. request_key() with a NULL
   callout_info never invokes a handler and returns ENOKEY when no
   matching key exists, so use request_key() with an empty string, or
   ``keyctl request2`` rather than ``keyctl request``. The content of
   the callout info is ignored.

 * The payload is the keyring serial as decimal ASCII digits with no
   terminating NUL. The return value of keyctl_read() gives the
   length; a buffer of 12 bytes is sufficient.

 * add_key() with this type accepts only that payload. A key carrying
   any other value is rejected with EINVAL, so a key found in the
   caller's keyrings always holds the serial of the caller's namespace.

 * The key type carries KEY_TYPE_NET_DOMAIN. A key instantiated in one
   network namespace does not answer a request made in another, so a
   process that keeps its session keyring across setns() receives the
   serial of the namespace it is in at the time of the request.

The serial is not a secret. The keyring's own permissions decide what
a caller can do with it.

Provisioning credentials
========================

Add the client certificate and private key to the .nfs keyring as
keys that grant no user read permission, then pass their serials as
cert_serial= and privkey_serial= mount options.
